## üß† CribDragger ‚Äî XOR Crib-Dragging Toolkit

`CribDragger` is a work-in-progress tool for performing crib-dragging attacks against XOR-encrypted messages. It combines NLTK wordlists, frequency analysis, and manual feedback loops to help recover plaintext and keystreams. This tool will work if you're 100% sure the target text contains common english words. It will require your input to validate keystreams.

### üöß Status

> This project is **still under development**. It works but it's far from polished.
>  
> Expect rough edges, occasional manual input, and iterative workflows.

### ‚úÖ Using the tool

```bash
pip install nltk pwntools colorama
python -m nltk.downloader words brown
```

example in Python:

```python

from crib_dragger import CribDragger, xor_key_text_list, check_potential_stream, print_text

# Initialize the tool
crib_dragger = CribDragger()
crib_dragger.initialize_word_list(default=True)

# You MUST know at least one partial plaintext to use this tool!

# If you're unsure where your plaintext appears in the list:
def find_potential_key(plaintext: bytes, encrypted_messages: list[bytes]):
    keystreams = xor_key_text_list(plaintext, encrypted_messages)
    for idx, key in enumerate(keystreams):
        result = check_potential_stream(key, encrypted_messages, strict=True)
        if result and plaintext in result:
            print(f'\nKeystream ID: {idx}')
            print_text(result)
            print(f'Target Index: {result.index(plaintext)}')
            print(f'Potential Key: {key.hex()}')

# Once you‚Äôve identified the initial key
initial_key = bytes.fromhex('')  # <-- insert the key you found here
result = crib_dragger.interactive_crib_dragging(initial_key, encrypted_messages)


```

### üßæ Output

The final `result` will be a tuple:

```python
((target_key, new_key), invalid_plaintexts)
```

- `target_key`: The key you started with  
- `new_key`: The extended XOR key discovered through crib-dragging  
- `invalid_plaintexts`: A list of encrypted messages that were removed due to invalid characters

> üîç **About `invalid_plaintexts`:**  

If any decrypted output contains disallowed characters (by default:  '"#$%&\\()*+/<=>@[\\]^`|~')

Then the tool will **interactively prompt you** to decide whether to remove the corresponding ciphertext.  
Removing problematic entries can improve the accuracy of key recovery ‚Äî especially in strict or filtered XOR streams.  
You can customize what characters are considered "invalid" by modifying the `extra_strict_check()` function.
